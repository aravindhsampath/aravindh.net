      <description>Context This is NOT an all-in post about ZFS performance. I built a FreeBSD+ZFS file server recently at work to serve as an offsite backup server. I wanted to run a few synthetic workloads on it and look at how it fares from performance perspective. Mostly for curiosity and learning purposes.
Performance As stated in the notes about building this server, performance was not one of the priorities, as this server will never face our active workload.</description>
