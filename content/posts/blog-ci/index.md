## Goal
Have a seamless way to write blog posts on my Mac and have the website transparently build and deploy upon saving the file locally.

## How?

## Noteshub.app

Finally!
An easy to use (local) Markdown editor that directly works with Github repository, as in transparently saves your files as a commit to the repository upon saving. Bonus - It has excalidraw built-in for making scgs like above.
