Here's what I am busy with:
* Building out this website - tinkering with Hugo
* Building a image gallery to showcase my woodworking projects.
* Thinking about a pull based deploy of this website. I keep committing my changes to Git, and a faithful watcher on my virtual machine that runs the website polls for changes and _deploys_ the changes periodically.
* Building out a headboard box for a friend.
