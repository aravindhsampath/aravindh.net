	<h2> Hi! </h2>
<p class="f6 f5-ns fw5 lh-copy center">
    Welcome to my personal space in the web. An engineer by heart, I like to tinker with things and make something useful out of them. Building this website and trying to keep it lean and fast is fun. For my $dayjob, I build/administer/manage a research cluster for a group of researchers from all over the world. Outside of my job, you can find me playing with my son, and when he gives us a break - design and make things with wood. I was born and raised in southern India and proudly speak தமிழ் (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_language"> Tamil </a>) in addition to English.

</p>
<p class="f6 f5-ns fw5 lh-copy center">
    I intend to use this blog as a means to share interesting tips and tricks which may help others and serve as a reference for myself. I host this blog myself, with no ads, and have every intention of keeping it very simple and useful.
